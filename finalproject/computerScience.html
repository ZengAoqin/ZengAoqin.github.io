					<h4>Program Description</h4>
					<p>
						Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today's
						greatest innovations? Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how
						Google's self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? Maybe
						you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity
						issues. AUM's Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE
						recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career
						in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology
						architecture.
					</p>
					<h4>Points of Pride</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You'll have access to the most powerful computational resources and expertise in the
						country through our partnership with the NSF-supported Extreme Science and Engineering
						Discovery Environment.
						</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 20px;">
							Computer Science faculty are engaged in the private sector, supporting research and partnerships
							with national and international user groups and initiatives.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Put Your Degree to Work</h4>
					<p>
						Note: While salaries vary depending on several factors including your level of experience, education and training, and geography and industry, here is a sampling of the future job growth
						and salaries in this area.
					<br/>
						Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12
						percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all other occupations. The most recent
						median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations $79,390 — higher
						than the median annual wage for all other occupations.

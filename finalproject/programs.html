					<h4>B.S. in Computer Science Plan of Study</h4>
					<p>Computer Science degree program is a relatively new discipline. The first such a program in the United States began in the 60's. In general, it is a science of using computers to solve problems. It is not about using software. With the advent of multicore systems, improvements in performance will depend on the effective use of parallelism. High Performance Computing is the main theme of this degree program. In addition to obtaining general computer science training, you will learn multicore architectures and programming. This is one of the hot new hardware and software developers jobs.</p>
					<h4>B.S. in Mathematics Plan of Study / B.S. in Mathematics Plan of Study 4-, 5-, 6- year map</h4>
					<p>The vigorous mathematical training allows you to take a problem, identify its essential features, and study or characterize them further. It has become a great tool for a variety of jobs. Professional schools such as medical school, law school, and pharmacy school often give priority to prospective students who have an undergraduate degree in mathematics. Our program gives you the unique opportunity to work closely with caring professors who are also leading researchers in their fields and have opportunities for you to get involved in their research.</p>
					<h4>B.S. in Mathematics/Secondary Education Plan of Study</h4>
					<p>A Secondary Education Mathematics degree prepares students to teach mathematics courses at the middle, junior, and senior high school levels (grades 6-12). Students will be assigned academic advisors in both the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and the Department of Curriculum, Instruction, and Technology</p>
					<h4>Pre-Engineering Program Plan of Study</h4>
					<p>The AUM Pre-Engineering Program (PEN) offers a strong foundation for students intending to earn bachelor degrees in engineering at the Auburn University Samuel Ginn College of Engineering. The Program takes approximately two years of full-time college work to complete before the student is ready to transfer over to the Auburn main campus.</p>
					<h4>M.S. in Computer Science Plan of Study</h4>
					<p>The M.S. program in computer science will give students specialized preparation in the broad area of Computer Science with four concentrations: a) General Computer Science, b) High Performance Computing, c) Data Analytics, and d) Computer and Cybersystems Security. After graduation students can advance their careers as computer professionals by taking various job 
						positions in the computing industry, research centers, government and academia. Specific employment opportunities include, but are not limited to, Computer and Information System Managers, Computer and Information Security Analysts, System and Application Software Developers, System Analysts, Data Center Administrators, Data Analysts, and Computational Scientists. Also, students will have the theoretical and practical preparation for continuing their education towards Ph.D. doctoral studies in the areas of Computer Science, Computational Science, Modeling and Simulation and Applied Mathematics.</p>
					<h4>M.S. in Computer Information Systems and Cyber Security Plan of Study</h4>
					<p>The Master of Science degree program in Cybersystems and Information Security (CSIS) prepares students to become leaders in the field of information and network security, offering instruction and research opportunities that provide graduates with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively assess, develop, and manage secure information networks and to respond to newly developed threats.</p>
					<span style="font-style: italic;">Students in this program can find jobs in:</span>
					<ul>
						<li>Information Technology</li>
						<li>Homeland Security</li>
						<li>Government and State Agencies</li>
						<li>Private Business</li>
						<li>Armed Forces</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Mathematics Minor Program of Study</h4>
					<p>The Mathematics Minor enables those with significant interest in mathematics to broaden their knowledge while pursuing a major in another field. This minor emphasizes developing your ability to apply mathematics and quantitative thinking when analyzing mathematical problems, making decisions, predicting outcomes, and verifying results.</p>
					<h4>Computer Science Minor Program of Study</h4>
					<p>Computation plays an important role in many areas. This minor can make you more attractive to prospective employers who are looking for people with computer skills in today's business world or make you ready for graduate studies that require computing skills. You will also be prepared for an entry-level computer science job.</p>
